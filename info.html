<p class="intro"><h1>Hello, Welcome to the info page.</h1></p>
<p class="body"><h2>I started with this game as anyone else would have, from scratch. I did not know a single thing
about this game, or what would happen in it. I started from nothing, but instead, just kept adding to it.
eventually, the first one got released, after many bug fixes and updates, some of which were not on Gamejolt
for long before I updated the game again, causing more bugs. this is when I thought of the holy hammer for
Wes, one of the three main characters.</p></h2>

and Real's dual swords, (again, no model). allowed for me to create ways and quests to upgrade them, 
all three of which are going to be coming in Real Content RPG 2's
next update.<h2>
